## __TL;DR__

Back in April I gave a talk introducing Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-learn for the [CERN Spring Campus 2017](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/cernspringcampus/) in Glasgow. On this post I highlight some of the most interesting parts of the talk.

## 2017 CERN Spring Campus

For the past 3 years the AIS group inside CERN, where I work has been organizing the Spring Campus in different Universities around Europe.
This year it was in Glasgow and I had the chance to participate by giving two talks, one titled _Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn_ and one on _Recommender Systems_ (I may cover some details of it in a future blog post).

## Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning is in fashion right now so this seemed like an interesting topic to cover that would attract the students attention.
Python and Scikit-Learn provide a simple way to cover introductory material mixing both the practical aspect and the theory behind.

I user an Ipython notebook to do the presentation, it's available [here](https://github.com/Joao-M-Almeida/ML-Tutorial/blob/master/Tutorial%20Notebook.ipynb).
