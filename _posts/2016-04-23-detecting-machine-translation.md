title: Detecting Machine Translation
---
### TL;DR
 I and Ricardo Martins decided to participate on the JEEC/Unbabel Machine Translation Detection Challenge, we ended in 4th place. The Code and dataset are available on the project [Github](https://github.com/Joao-M-Almeida/JEECUnbabelChallenge).

### The Challenge


At the [JEEC16](http://jeec.tecnico.pt/jeec16/) (a Electrical and Computer Engineering event organized by the students at [Técnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt)) conference [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/) (a Portuguese startup that does human powered machine translation) went to give a talk and proposed a challenge to the students attending. I and Ricardo Martins decided to participate.

The __goal__ of the challenge was, given a dataset, to create a model that would distinguish between human translated and machine translated.


### Final Results:
  Voting Classifier based on LDA, LogisticRegression and AdaBoost with Dimensionality reduction by Pricinpal component analysis achieved a cross validation score of (55.0 +/- 1.6)% and a final result of 57.8%.
