Here you can find a list of some of the projects I am or was involved in.

### HackerSchool

[HackerSchool](http://hackerschool.io) is a student group at [TÃ©cnico Lisboa](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt) focused on developing projects and ideas and on knowledge sharing. We beleive in a Hacker mentality of thinkering and experimentation. We follow [Richard Stallman's](http://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html) definition of Hacking.

I was the leader of HackerSchool for one year and have been a member for 4 years.

On one of events, the __LX Reactor Winter Edition - 2014__, with a few friends I built an awesome __RGB LED Tower__, you can check the [Github](https://github.com/HackerSchool/LEDtower) repo for photos. 

### Contests

- __[JEEC](http://jeec.tecnico.pt/jeec16/) / [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/) 2016 challenge__: more about it [here](../2016/04/30/detecting-machine-translation/).
