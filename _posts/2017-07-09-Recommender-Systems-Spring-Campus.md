## __TL;DR__

Back in April I gave a talk on Recommender Systems for the [CERN Spring Campus 2017](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/60thanniversary/cernspringcampus/) in Glasgow.
The presentation is embedded at the end of this post or you can download it [from my github](https://github.com/Joao-M-Almeida/Joao-M-Almeida.github.io/raw/master/public/RecommenderSystemsSpringCampus2017.pdf).

## Recommender Systems

Recommender Systems help users navigate the overwhelming amounts of information available online.

I had been working on this topic for my thesis where I was applying them to tech recruitment on [Landing.jobs](https://Landing.jobs) data.
This seemed like a good opportunity to share a little bit of my knowledge and interest on the area.
